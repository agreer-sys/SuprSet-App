# Progressive Overload

Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during training. It's the fundamental principle behind strength and muscle gains.

## Key Principles

- **Increase weight incrementally**: Add 2.5-5 lbs when you can complete all prescribed reps with good form
- **Prioritize form over weight**: Never sacrifice technique for heavier loads
- **Track everything**: Keep detailed records of weight, reps, and rest periods
- **Be patient**: Strength gains take time - consistency beats intensity

## Common Mistakes

- **Jumping weight too quickly**: Adding 10-20 lbs at once increases injury risk
- **Ignoring recovery**: Progressive overload requires adequate rest between sessions
- **Poor form under load**: Bad technique reinforces bad movement patterns
- **Expecting linear progress**: Strength gains will plateau - that's normal

## Coaching Cues

"Let's add 5 pounds today - you crushed that last week."

"Form looked solid on that set. If you hit 12 reps clean, we'll bump the weight next time."

"We're building strength for the long term. Don't rush the process."

## Application

For strength training (3-5 sets of 6-12 reps):
- Hit the top of your rep range for all sets with good form
- Increase weight by smallest increment available (2.5-5 lbs)
- If you fail to complete all reps, stay at that weight until you succeed

Remember: Progressive overload isn't just about adding weight. You can also increase reps, sets, training frequency, or decrease rest periods.
